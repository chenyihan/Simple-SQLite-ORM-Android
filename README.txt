This is a simple sqlite ORM framework for android. It allows you to access sqlite db conveniently with a OO style, you only need to need to pay attention to the org.cyy.fw.android.dborm.sqlite.SqliteDBFacade class.
You need to a android SDK and eclipse with ADT plugin first, and import this project by eclipse to run it.
If you have any issues, contact me please. Looking forward to discussing with you.
Enjoy!
